This is the original PiStorm2K converted from Gerbers to KiCAD and appropriate footprints applied.

There were a *LOT* of changes made in v2.0 that are not reflected back in v1.0, this version is not suitable for production as it currently stands. 

Most of the issues are because it was imported from Gerbers all of the pads/paste/solder masks are individual items not footprints. I cleaned up some but even when putting V2.0 into order I spotted I'd missed some! 
It's probably not *as* critical with v1.0 as nothing moved but be aware of it. 


USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
